        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken in coconut milk is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>Â½ cup sliced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and stir in ginger. Cook and stir until fragrant and
                lightly browned. Remove ginger and set aside.</li>

            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken in the same skillet over medium-high heat without
                crowding. Cook until chicken is lightly brown on all sides.</li>

            <li>Return ginger to the skillet and add coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then cover with the lid tilted to
                allow steam to escape. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no
                longer pink at the bone, about 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir in spinach and simmer uncovered until spinach is warmed through, 8 to 12 minutes. Season with salt
                and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
