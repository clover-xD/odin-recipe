    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </li>
